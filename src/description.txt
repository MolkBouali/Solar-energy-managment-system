Hello and welcome to the Energy Management System!

Our system allows you to simulate and manage various solar energy-related operations. It comprises different entities, including clients, energy manager, batteries, solar panels. Let's explore the key features:

Clients:
Unique entities located in specific regions, classified as buyers, sellers, or members.
Autonomously manage energy components like batteries and solar panels to meet individual needs.
Engage in energy transactions, buying and selling energy capacities.

Energy Components:
Batteries:
Simulate charging and discharging operations, impacting energy storage.
Solar Panels:
Simulate power generation taking into account sunlight levels and the time of day.
Adjust orientation based on sensor feedback (light and temperature) for optimal power generation.

Component List Management:
Clients autonomously add and remove components from their personal lists.
The EnergyManager manages a centralized list of all components within a shared location providing a comprehensive view of the energy landscape and reflects system-level considerations.
